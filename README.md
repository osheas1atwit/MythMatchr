# MythMatcher - COMP4960 Final Project 
## Instructor: Professor Gyllinsky

### This is our final project for Software Engineering. The meat and potatoes of our code can be found in the MythMatcher/Assets/Scripts/ folder. To install, clone this repo into Unity (version 2021.3.16f1) and build the project. Alternatively, an executable may be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WexVwxeEXa23TS78dbG35dPkxtFYEbSZ/view?usp=share_link) and is much easier to work with.


MythMatchr is an educational matching video game where the player matches mythological entities to their country of origin. For example, if the prompt was “Zombie - A reanimated corpse”, the player would select the country that they believe zombies originated from (the correct answer is Haiti). The goal of creating this game is to provide an entertaining but educational experience for students and children ages 7-13. The players will passively learn geography while engaging in a matching game dealing with topics they may enjoy and find familiar. The game is intended to be played either solo as a learning tool, or multiplayer in a classroom setting where students can compete amongst each other.
NOTE: MythMatchr is in a prolonged state of unfinished-ness. Multiplayer is not available.
